# My Dev Blog Posts

This repository contains my blog post work. A few topics I'll be touching on in these: 
- My journey as an early career full stack engineer
- Developer education and two open source projects I contribute to in that domain: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and [The Agency of Learning](https://agencyoflearning.com/)
- The Ruby/Rails ecosystem

When complete, these posts will be shared via [my dev.to](https://dev.to/joshdevhub).
